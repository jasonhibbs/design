A product development process from the Basecamp team.

From the introduction:

## [Six-week cycles](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#six-week-cycles)

Long enough to build something meaningful, short enough that everyone can feel the deadline looming from the start. Our decisions are based on moving the product forward in the next six weeks, not micromanaging time.

## [Shaping the work](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02)
Shape the work before giving it to a team. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they have room to work out the interesting details themselves.

Instead of asking how much time it will take to do some work, we ask: How much time do we want to spend? How much is this idea worth? This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the constraints of our appetite.

## [Making teams responsible](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.1-chapter-10)
Full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. This is completely different from other methodologies, where managers chop up the work and programmers act like ticket-takers.

Together, these concepts form a virtuous circle. When teams are more autonomous, senior people can spend less time managing and can shape up better projects. When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and so can work more autonomously.

## [Targeting risk](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.4-chapter-05)
We reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions before we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.

We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.

And lastly we reduce risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.
