# Design Thinking

In reality, "design thinking" is simply the thinking within design.

>Design thinking refers to the cognitive, strategic and practical processes by which design concepts are developed.
> — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking)

In business-world, "design thinking" refers to variants of models popularised by [IDEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEO) and [Stanford’s d.school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasso_Plattner_Institute_of_Design).

>In the end, design thinking is not about design. … It’s about commercialization. It’s about making education a superficial form of business training.
> – [Lee Vinsel, Chronicle](https://www.chronicle.com/article/design-thinking-is-a-boondoggle/).

## Models

Originally five steps, Assess has been added recently as well as the asterisk "not necessarily linear".

1. Empathise
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test
6. Assess

1. **Empathize:** Conduct research in order to develop knowledge about what your users do, say, think, and feel.
2. **Define:** Combine all your research and observe where your users’ problems exist. In pinpointing your users’ needs, begin to highlight opportunities for innovation.
3. **Ideate:** Brainstorm a range of crazy, creative ideas that address the unmet user needs identified in the define phase. Give yourself and your team total freedom; no idea is too farfetched and quantity supersedes quality.
4. **Prototype:** Build real, tactile representations for a subset of your ideas. The goal of this phase is to understand what components of your ideas work, and which do not. In this phase you begin to weigh the impact vs. feasibility of your ideas through feedback on your prototypes.
5. **Test:** Return to your users for feedback. Ask yourself ‘Does this solution meet users’ needs?’ and ‘Has it improved how they feel, think, or do their tasks?’
6. **Implement:** Put the vision into effect. Ensure that your solution is materialized and touches the lives of your end users.

> Each phase is meant to be iterative and cyclical as opposed to a strictly linear process, as depicted below.

> You can also repeat phases. It’s often necessary to do an exercise within a phase multiple times in order to arrive at the outcome needed to move forward.

## Thoughts

For the purpose of labelling steps of a process it’s adequate. As an overloaded term it’s problematic.

Separating "Empathise" and "Test" is useful to communicate different kinds of discovery, where empathise is a definitive start point. I sense "Assess" and "Implement" have been added to show some finality.

If I were mapping this to [[Double Diamond]] I would suggest that "Test → Assess" and "Test → Implement" is a kind of secound round:

- Empathise = Discover
- Define = Define
- Ideate = Develop
- Prototype = Deliver
- Test = Discover and Define
- Implement = Develop and Deliver
