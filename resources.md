# Resources

## Software

### Graphics

- [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html), still the most competent pen tool out there.
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/), less complete than Illustrator, but I’ve found it much better for exporting.
- [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html), I don’t use raster graphics often these days, but I know it well.

### Prototyping

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), free and setting the standard in prototyping.
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html), catching up with Figma quickly, good for OS and Adobe integration, best for device preview and recording animations.


### Collaboration

- [Miro](https://miro.com), an exceptional whiteboarding tool
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), for documentation at least, planning perhaps
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), for mocking and producing interfaces
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/), for sharing design assets

### Development

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), a lightweight, performant, user-friendly, web-friendly, JavaScript framework.
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/), a very nice frontend to git.
- [Github](https://github.com/), public and private repos are free, most open code is here.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), free hosting and continuous deployment for Jamstack apps.

### Testing

- [Usability Hub](https://usabilityhub.com/), looks good for quick remote testing

### Other

- [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/), simulates colour-blindness on macOS and iOS.
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), API explorer, a bit prettier than Postman
- [1Password](https://1password.com/), I have more than 800 different passwords, I’ve not manually typed any, except the one that holds these, for years.
- [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00gru6), continuous online remote backup.
