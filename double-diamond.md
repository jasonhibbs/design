# Double Diamond

A model by the [Design Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Council) in 2005, built on an idea of divergence and convergence across four phases.

[Since an update](https://medium.com/design-leadership-notebook/the-new-double-diamond-design-process-7c8f12d7945e), they call it the "Framework for Innovation", emphasising iteration and principles.

Key extracts [from Design Council’s article](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond):

## Process

1. **Discover.** The first diamond helps people understand, rather than simply assume, what the problem is. It involves speaking to and spending time with people who are affected by the issues.
2. **Define.** The insight gathered from the discovery phase can help you to define the challenge in a different way.
3. **Develop.** The second diamond encourages people to give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people.
4. **Deliver**. Delivery involves testing out different solutions at small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and improving the ones that will.

<mark>This is not a linear process</mark> as the arrows on the diagram show. Many of the organisations we support learn something more about the underlying problems which can send them back to the beginning. Making and testing very early stage ideas can be part of discovery. And in an ever-changing and digital world, <mark>no idea is ever ‘finished’</mark>. We are constantly getting feedback on how products and services are working and iteratively improving them.

## Principles

- **Put people first**. Start with an understanding of the people using a service, their needs, strengths and aspirations.
- **Communicate visually and inclusively**. Help people gain a shared understanding of the problem and ideas.
- **Collaborate and co-create**. Work together and get inspired by what others are doing.
- **Iterate, iterate, iterate**. Do this to spot errors early, avoid risk and build confidence in your ideas.

## Methods

- **Explore**: challenges, needs and opportunities
- **Shape**: prototypes, insights and visions
- **Build**: ideas, plans and expertise

## Culture

**Leadership** is needed to encourage innovation, build skills and capability, provide permission for experimentation and learning. Strong leadership also allows projects to be open and agile, showing results along the way and being able to change.

**Engagement** is needed with people who are delivering the ideas and receiving them, but also with other partners who might have other ideas. Developing connections and building relationships is as important as creating ideas.
