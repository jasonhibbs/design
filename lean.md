## Lean Software Development

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development)

Lean software development is a translation of lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development domain.

### Principles

1. Eliminate waste
2. Amplify learning
3. Decide as late as possible
4. Deliver as fast as possible
5. Empower the team
6. Build integrity in
7. Optimize the whole



## Lean UX

### [What is Lean UX? by Jonathan Follett](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-lean-ux/)

Lean UX is driven by a set of core principles, each focused on maximizing value and minimizing waste in software design. The Lean UX cycle can be expressed as think-make-check, not dissimilar from the Lean Startup method’s build-measure-learn feedback loop.

#### Cycle

1. **Think:** articulate assumptions about a problem, form a hypothesis that we can test, describe a successful outcome.
2. **Make:** co-design, make an MVP to help us test with real users. Move the design forward, rather than aiming for specific deliverables.
3. **Check:** talk with customers at regular intervals, distribute feedback across the entire team, develop a shared understanding.

#### Principles

- Act as one team
- Solve the right problem
- Design collaboratively
- Exercise flexibility
- De-emphasize deliverables

### [Lean UX, by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden](https://www.academia.edu/6792206/Lean_UX_Applying_Lean_Principles_to_Improve_User_Experience)

#### Principles

- Cross-Functional Teams
- Small, Dedicated, Colocated
- Progress = Outcomes, Not Output
- Problem-Focused Teams
- Removing Waste
- Small Batch Size
- Continuous Discovery
- GOOB: The New User-Centricity
- Shared Understanding
- Anti-Pattern: Rockstars, Gurus, and Ninjas
- Externalizing Your Work
- Making over Analysis
- Learning over Growth
- Permission to Fail
- Getting Out of the Deliverables Business

#### Process

1. **Vision, Framing, and Outcomes:** the goal is not to create a deliverable, it’s to change something in the world.
2. **Collaborative Design:** become more collaborative, aim for speed ﬁrst, prioritize learning.
3. **MVPs and Experiments:** use experiments to test assumptions and build on what we learn.
4. **Feedback and Research:** get feedback early and often, and incorporate into future  iterations.
