## Biases

Fact is, brains have them. People making things rely on them as much as people using things do. We have to check them during production and we have to expect them in practice.

Accommodate them, donâ€™t exploit them. The line is fine between, say, nudging people to donate their organs by default and constructing a social environment that produces herd immunity via herd mentality.
